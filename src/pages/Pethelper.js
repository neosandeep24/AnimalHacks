                <h3>Warmth: Keep the environment warm using heating pads or warm blankets, as newborns cannot regulate their body temperature well.</h3>
                <h3>Socialization: Gently handle the young ones to help them become accustomed to human touch and sounds.</h3>
                <h3>Veterinary Care: Schedule a vet visit for a health check, vaccinations, and deworming.</h3>
                <h3>Weaning: Introduce soft, age-appropriate solid food around 3-4 weeks of age. Mix it with formula to create a slurry.</h3>
                <h3>Litter Training: For kittens, introduce a litter box with low sides. They will naturally start using it.</h3>
                <h3>Playtime: Encourage light play and exploration to develop motor skills and curiosity.</h3>
